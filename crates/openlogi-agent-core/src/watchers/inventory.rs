//! Polling HID inventory watcher.
//!
//! Spawns a dedicated OS thread with a one-shot tokio runtime that calls
//! `openlogi_hid::enumerate` every `period` and forwards each completed
//! snapshot over an unbounded mpsc to the agent's select loop, which applies
//! it via `Orchestrator::refresh_inventory`.
//!
//! Polling beats hot-plug event registration on simplicity: HID transport
//! crates ship different listener APIs across platforms, and `async-hid 0.4`
//! does not expose any. A 2 s tick is cheap (one HID enumerate per cycle ≤
//! a few hundred milliseconds) and matches the human-perceptible reconnect
//! latency budget in PLAN.md.
